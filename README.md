# R-Neural-Network
As part of a group research project we attempt to use neural networks to solve problems related to computer vision and game strategy. This repository is home to my R source code. 

(Edit: This repo is no longer supported as of Jan 2016)

Note: this code is an implementation of neural networks completely from scratch, along with Q-learning code for several games. Although it is messy and somewhat incomplete, it might provide a useful baseline for future research.
