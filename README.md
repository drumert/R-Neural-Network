# R-Neural-Network
As part of a group research project we attempt to use neural networks to solve problems related to computer vision and game strategy. This repository is home to my R source code. 

(Edit: This repo is no longer supported as of Jan 2016)

Note: this code is an implementation of neural networks completely from scratch, along with Q-learning code for several games. Although it is messy and somewhat incomplete, it might provide a useful baseline for future research.

As a technical aside: this code is really old and represents my novice attempts to both understand machine learning and understand R. The results from this project are neither verified nor trustworthy, but are made available in the event that they may prove useful.
